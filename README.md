Automating Infrastructure with Terraform, Proxmox & Ansible! 
As part of the OSFP DevOps Bootcamp led by Sir Babar Zahoor, I have designed a fully automated lab environment! Using Terraform, I deployed four virtual machines on Proxmox, and with Ansible, I provisioned them effortlessly. 
ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:
 âœ… Terraform for automated VM deployment on Proxmox
 âœ… Ansible for seamless configuration management
 âœ… Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for repeatability & scalability
 âœ… Fully automated and efficient DevOps workflow
This lab is a perfect demonstration of modern DevOps practices, ensuring consistency and automation in infrastructure management. Excited to keep learning and building! ðŸ’¡
